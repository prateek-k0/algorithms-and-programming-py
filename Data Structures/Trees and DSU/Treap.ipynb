Assuming that all X and all Y are different, we can see that if some node of the tree contains values (X0, Y0), all nodes in the left subtree have X<X0, all nodes in the right subtree have X>X0, and all nodes in both left and right subtrees have Y<Y0."

    "##### Adds a new node to the tree. One possible variant is to pass only X and generate Y randomly inside the operation (while ensuring that it's different from all other priorities in the tree).\n",
    "### Search(x) : O(logN)\n",
    "##### looks for a node with the specified key value X. The implementation is the same as for an ordinary binary search tree.\n",
    "### Erase(x) : O(logN)\n",
    "##### Looks for a node with the specified key value X and removes it from the tree.\n",
    "### Build(x0,x1,...xn) : O(N)\n",
    "##### Builds a tree from a list of values. This can be done in linear time (assuming that X1,...,XN are sorted). We will just use N serial calls of Insert operation, which has O(NlogN) complexity.\n",
    "### Union(T1, T2) : O(Mlog(N/M))\n",
    "##### Merges two trees, assuming that all the elements are different. It is possible to achieve the same complexity if duplicate elements should be removed during merge.\n",
    "### Intersect(T1, T2) : O(Mlog(N/M))\n",
    "##### Finds the intersection of two trees (i.e. their common elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "### In addition, due to the fact that a treap is a binary search tree, it can implement other operations, such as finding the K-th largest element or finding the index of an element.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Auxiliary Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Split(T, x) : O(logn)\n",
    "##### separates tree T in 2 subtrees L and R trees (which are the return values of split) so that L contains all elements with key XL<X, and R contains all elements with key XR>X.  implemented using recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merge(T1, T2) : O(logn)\n",
    "##### combines two subtrees T1 and T2 and returns the new tree. It works under the assumption that T1 and T2 are ordered (all keys X in T1 are smaller than keys in T2). Thus, we need to combine these trees without violating the order of priorities Y. To do this, we choose as the root the tree which has higher priority Y in the root node, and recursively call Merge for the other tree and the corresponding subtree of the selected root node."
