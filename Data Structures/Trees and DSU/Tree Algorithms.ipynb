The second is that the color of the root is blue. Now, we need to consider both options and find the minimum of them.  For each approach, we apply dfs to the tree to check if the color of the node in the given string is the desired color or not (DFS -> Bottom up Fashion). If the color is not the desired one, then we add the nodes color to its subtree. Hence, we form a \"BALANCE TREE\" for each node, which checks the balance of color in its subtree. For the tree rooted at 0, the balance should always be zero, otherwise, it is impossible to swap nodes for a balanced arrangements.\n",

This can be calculated using a variable to add the distance of each unbalanced node to the root of a subtree, until the node is balanced. (in this case, it is \"ans\")\n",
