    "#### Like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming combines solutions to sub-problems. Dynamic Programming is mainly used when solutions of same subproblems are needed again and again. In dynamic programming, computed solutions to subproblems are stored in a table so that these don’t have to be recomputed. So Dynamic Programming is not useful when there are no common (overlapping) subproblems because there is no point storing the solutions if they are not needed again. For example, Binary Search doesn’t have common subproblems. If we take an example of following recursive program for Fibonacci Numbers, there are many subproblems which are solved again and again.\n",

If the precomputed value is there then we return that value, otherwise, we calculate the value and put the result in the lookup table so that it can be reused later."
